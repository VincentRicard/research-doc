The questions are : how do you share your work, and to what audiences?\r\n\r\n###How to contribute?\r\n\r\nMany ways can be valuable, and this call to contribution must be adapted to your project and the time you have :\r\n- Fork this repository, and create a folder in which you can upload some documentation. The format is free, and what makes sense with your process is the most important criteria. If you don’t know how to fork or you’re not familiar with GitHub, you can follow this steps, or go directly to the next point.\r\n\r\n>1. Click on the « view on Github » button in the left sidebar.\r\n>1. Click on Fork.\r\n>1. Create a folder : I suggest to put your name or the name of your project as the title. The content must stick to your process, and can be either explanatory notes, documentation or links to other pages.\r\n\r\n- Contact me by mail at [vcent.ricard@gmail.com](mailto:vcent.ricard@gmail.com). Maybe the easiest way, and then we can set up a meeting, an interview, or I can just send you a quick list of questions depending of what you want to do.\r\n\r\n###What kind of knowledge are you looking for?\r\n\r\nAnything. It can be how you organise your documentation, how you translate it to a blog format, informal or formal rationales that guide your design process.\r\n\r\n###How will you use it?\r\n\r\nThe more different formats I get will help me get an overview about how design researchers work and which ways they share early results. The goal of this study is to show that we can trigger discussions within and without the different research communities by sharing results before the written format, and that it can be valuable for everybody.\r\n\r\nI will then prototype design principles that would help the community to find other ways of sharing knowledge. Those principles will be available in my Master thesis, and also on an online version.",
